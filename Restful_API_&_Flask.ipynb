HTTP is fundamentally stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent and the server doesn't inherently remember information about previous requests from the same client. The session object provides a way to maintain state for a particular user as they interact with your Flask application.\n",

        "Here's a breakdown of the theoretical role of Flask's session object:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Maintaining State: The primary purpose of the session object is to store information that needs to persist for a user throughout their interaction with the application. This information is not stored on the server in a way that makes it accessible globally, but rather is associated with the specific user's session.\n",

The signing ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with by the client. However, the actual data is sent to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Server-Side Storage (with extensions): For sensitive data or larger amounts of data, it's often preferable to store session data on the server. Flask extensions like Flask-Session or Flask-KVSession provide options for server-side session storage using various backends like databases, Redis, or Memcached. In this case, the cookie only contains a session ID, which is used by the server to retrieve the corresponding session data.\n",

When using client-side sessions, the data is visible to the client, although it's signed to prevent tampering. Server-side sessions are generally more secure for sensitive information as the data remains on the server. It's also crucial to use a strong secret key for signing the session cookie to prevent attackers from forging session data.\n",
